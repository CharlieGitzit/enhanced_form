# 🌍 Immigration Intake Experience

A calm, guided way to prepare immigration information before speaking with a licensed professional.

This project provides a conversational intake experience that mirrors the structure of official U.S. immigration forms. Instead of overwhelming users with complex paperwork, it walks them through key questions step by step — helping them organize details clearly, confidently, and respectfully.

The goal is simple: reduce stress, improve clarity, and make professional consultations more productive.
